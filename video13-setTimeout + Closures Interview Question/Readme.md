A closure in JavaScript is a function that has access to its own scope, the outer function's scope, and the global scope. It has access to variables from these three scopes even after the outer function has finished execution.

Here's how the code you provided works:

```javascript
function x() {
  var i = 1;
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(i);
  }, 1000);
  console.log("Some Statement");
}
x();
```

In this code, `x` is a function that declares a variable `i` and sets it to `1`. It then sets a timer to execute a function after `1000` milliseconds (or 1 second). This function logs the value of `i` to the console. After setting the timer, `x` immediately logs `"Some Statement"` to the console.

When you call `x()`, `"Some Statement"` is logged to the console immediately, and `1` is logged to the console after 1 second.

The function passed to `setTimeout` is a closure. It's a function that's defined inside `x`, and it has access to `x`'s scope. This means it can access `x`'s variables, including `i`, even after `x` has finished executing. This is why it can log the value of `i` after 1 second, even though `x` has already finished executing by that time.

So, in terms of closures, the function passed to `setTimeout` is a closure that captures the variable `i` from its containing function `x`. Even after the function `x` has finished execution, the closure still has access to `i`, which is why it can log `i` to the console after 1 second. This is a powerful feature of JavaScript and a common use case for closures.

# Let's consider the following code snippets:

```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(i);
  }, i * 1000);
}
```

and

```javascript
for (var i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(i);
  }, i * 1000);
}
```

In the first snippet, `let` is used to declare `i`. In the second snippet, `var` is used instead. The difference in output is due to how `var` and `let` handle scoping.

**With `let`:** When you use `let` to declare `i`, a new `i` is created for each loop iteration. So each function created by `setTimeout()` gets its own `i`. That's why it logs `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`.

**With `var`:** When you use `var` to declare `i`, there's only one `i` for the whole `for` loop. So by the time the functions created by `setTimeout()` start running, the `for` loop has already finished, and `i` is `6`. That's why it logs `6`, `6`, `6`, `6`, `6`.

This is a great example of closures and lexical scoping in JavaScript:

- A closure is a function that remembers the variables from the place where it was created, even if that place has gone away. Each function created by `setTimeout()` is a closure that remembers its own `i`.

- Lexical scoping means that a function can use any variables in the scope where it was defined. In the case of `let`, each loop iteration has its own scope, so each function remembers a different `i`. But with `var`, there's only one scope for the whole `for` loop, so every function remembers the same `i`.

# let the same output by using var only:

```js
function x() {
  for (var i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    function close(x) {
      setTimeout(() => {
        console.log(x);
      }, x * 1000);
    }
    close(i);
  }
  console.log("Some Statement");
}

x();
```

If i try to modify the above code ,we can also get the same output 1 2 3 4 5 by using var only

Now, let's break down your code:

1. You have a `for` loop that runs from 1 to 5. For each iteration, it calls a function named `close` with the current value of `i`.

2. Inside the `close` function, there's a `setTimeout` function that waits for `x` seconds (where `x` is the current value of `i`) and then logs `x` to the console.

3. After the `for` loop, you have a `console.log` statement that logs "Some Statement" to the console.

Here's how closures come into play:

When you call the `close` function with `i`, the inner function within `setTimeout` forms a closure. This means it 'remembers' the value of `x` (which is `i` in that iteration) even after the `close` function has finished executing. So, each `setTimeout` callback function has its own `x` value that it remembers and logs to the console after `x` seconds.

However, there's a problem with your code. The `x();` call at the end seems to be a mistake, as `x` is not a function in this context.

Here's a corrected version of your code that uses `var` and demonstrates closures:

```javascript
for (var i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  (function (x) {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log(x);
    }, x * 1000);
  })(i);
}
console.log("Some Statement");
```

In this corrected code, we're immediately invoking a function for each loop iteration and passing `i` as an argument. This creates a new scope for each `i`, demonstrating closures.
