# What is Callback Hell?

Callback hell occurs when there are multiple nested callbacks, making the code look complex, difficult to read, and hard to maintain. When functions depend on other asynchronous operations and are nested inside each other like layers, it results in a deeply indented "pyramid-like" shape.

### Let's take an Example:

```js
const cart = ["shoes", "pants", "kurta"];
api.createOrder(cart, function () {
  api.proceedToPayment(function () {
    api.showOrderSummary(function () {
      api.updateWallet();
    });
    I;
  });
});
```

### Breaking It Down:

1. `api.createOrder(cart, function () {...})` creates an order with the cart items. Once this finishes, it calls the provided function (the callback).
2. Inside this first callback, another function `api.proceedToPayment(function () {...})` is executed, and another callback is passed in.
3. In this second callback, `api.showOrderSummary(function () {...})` is called, and it also contains a callback.
4. Lastly, inside the third callback, `api.updateWallet();` is executed.

### Why is it a Problem?

- The code is deeply nested, making it challenging to understand the flow.
- If you want to modify any part of this sequence, you'll have to go through multiple levels of nesting.
- Error handling can be messy in this structure.

### Solution:

You can use **Promises** or **async/await** to make the code more readable. For example, using promises, it might look like this:

## Promise
A Promises is an **object** representing the eventual completion or failure of an **asynchronous Operation** . 

[Promise from freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-promise-object-explained/)

```javascript
api
  .createOrder(cart)
  .then(() => api.proceedToPayment())
  .then(() => api.showOrderSummary())
  .then(() => api.updateWallet())
  .catch((error) => console.error("An error occurred:", error));
```

This makes the code flatter, more readable, and easier to handle errors.



# How we can create our Promises:

### **What is Happening?**
Your code simulates an **online shopping process** using **Promises** in JavaScript. Promises are a way to handle asynchronous tasks, meaning tasks that take some time to complete (like ordering an item or making a payment). This code performs three main steps:

1. **Create an order for the items in the cart.**
2. **Proceed to payment for the order.**
3. **Handle success or errors in the process.**

---

### **The Steps in Detail**

#### **1. Declaring the `cart`**
```javascript
const cart = ["shoes", "pants", "kurta"];
```
This is a list (array) of items the customer wants to buy.

---

#### **2. Calling the `createOrder(cart)` Function**
```javascript
createOrder(cart)
```
- `createOrder(cart)` is a **function that creates an order** based on the items in the cart.
- It returns a **Promise**, which is like a "promise to do something in the future."

---

#### **3. Inside the `createOrder` Function**
```javascript
function createOrder(cart) {
  const pr = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
    if (!validateCart(cart)) {
      const err = new Error("Cart is not valid");
      reject(err);
    }
    const orderId = "12345";
    if (orderId) {
      setTimeout(function () {
        resolve(orderId);
      }, 5000);
    }
  });
  return pr;
}
```
- The `Promise` has two parts: **`resolve`** (for success) and **`reject`** (for failure).
- **Steps inside `createOrder`:**
  1. **Cart Validation:** It checks if the cart is valid using `validateCart(cart)`. If invalid, it triggers `reject(err)`, and the process stops.
     - Here, the cart is always valid because `validateCart` returns `true`.
  2. **Simulating Order Creation:** An `orderId` is assigned ("12345"). After 5 seconds, the function resolves with the `orderId`.
  3. **Return the Promise:** The function returns the promise (`pr`).

---

#### **4. Handling the `createOrder` Promise**
```javascript
.then(function (orderId) {
  console.log(orderId);
  return orderId;
})
```
- The `.then()` block runs when the `createOrder` promise is resolved successfully.
- The `orderId` ("12345") is logged and passed to the next `.then()`.

---

#### **5. Calling `proceedToPayment(orderId)`**
```javascript
.then(function (orderId) {
  return proceedToPayment(orderId);
})
```
- `proceedToPayment(orderId)` starts the payment process for the given order ID.
- This also returns a **Promise**.

---

#### **6. Inside `proceedToPayment`**
```javascript
function proceedToPayment(orderId) {
  return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
    resolve("Payment Successful");
  });
}
```
- This function simulates the payment process.
- It **always resolves** with the message `"Payment Successful"`.

---

#### **7. Handling the Payment Promise**
```javascript
.then(function (paymentInfo) {
  console.log(paymentInfo);
})
```
- Once the payment promise is resolved, it logs the success message: `"Payment Successful"`.

---

#### **8. Handling Errors**
```javascript
.catch(function (err) {
  console.log(err.message);
});
```
- If anything goes wrong (like an invalid cart), the `.catch()` block catches the error and logs its message.

---

### **Summary Flow**
1. A cart is validated.
2. If the cart is valid:
   - An order ID is generated after 5 seconds.
   - Payment is processed for the order.
   - If successful, the message `"Payment Successful"` is displayed.
3. If any step fails, the `.catch()` block logs the error.

---

### **Output of the Code**
If there are no errors:
1. After 5 seconds: `12345` (Order ID)
2. Immediately after: `Payment Successful`

# Promise Chaining

This code is an example of **Promise chaining**, where multiple asynchronous operations are executed one after the other in a specific order. Let's break it down step by step and explain the flow:

---

### 1. **Cart and Initial Function Call**
- You have an array `cart` that contains some items: `["shoes", "pants", "kurta"]`.
- The `createOrder(cart)` function is called to start the process of creating an order for the items in the cart.

---

### 2. **`createOrder(cart)` Function**
This function is responsible for creating an order. It:
1. **Returns a Promise**: 
   - A **Promise** is like a "future container" for a value that might be available later.
2. **Inside the Promise**:
   - First, it validates the cart using the `validateCart(cart)` function, which returns `true` (indicating the cart is valid in this case).
   - If the cart is invalid, the `reject()` function is called with an error message: `"Cart is not valid"`. This stops further execution and jumps to the `.catch()` block.
   - If the cart is valid, an `orderId` is created (hardcoded as `"12345"` here) and resolved after a 5-second delay using `setTimeout`.

   ### In Simple Words:
   - If the cart is valid, the order is created, and the `orderId` is returned.
   - If the cart is invalid, the Promise is rejected with an error.

---

### 3. **Promise Chaining with `createOrder(cart)`**
After calling `createOrder(cart)`, you use `.then()` to chain operations:
```javascript
createOrder(cart)
  .then(function (orderId) {
    console.log(orderId); // Logs "12345" after 5 seconds
    return orderId; // Passes `orderId` to the next `.then()`
  })
```
- When the `createOrder` Promise resolves, the first `.then()` is executed.
- The `orderId` ("12345") is logged to the console.
- The `orderId` is returned so the next `.then()` can use it.

---

### 4. **`proceedToPayment(orderId)` Function**
- This function is called in the second `.then()`:
```javascript
.then(function (orderId) {
  return proceedToPayment(orderId);
})
```
- It **returns a new Promise** that resolves with the message `"Payment Successful"`.
- This simulates the payment process based on the `orderId`.

---

### 5. **Chaining with `proceedToPayment`**
- The `proceedToPayment(orderId)` Promise resolves with the message `"Payment Successful"`.
- This message is passed to the third `.then()`:
```javascript
.then(function (paymentInfo) {
  console.log(paymentInfo); // Logs "Payment Successful"
})
```
- The final `.then()` logs the payment success message to the console.

---

### 6. **Error Handling with `.catch()`**
- If at any point a Promise is rejected (e.g., if the cart is invalid), the `.catch()` block is executed:
```javascript
.catch(function (err) {
  console.log(err.message); // Logs the error message
});
```
- In this case, the error message `"Cart is not valid"` would be logged if the cart validation fails.

---

### **How the Flow Works**
1. `createOrder(cart)` starts the order creation process.
2. If the cart is valid:
   - It resolves with the `orderId` ("12345") after 5 seconds.
3. The `orderId` is passed to `proceedToPayment(orderId)`.
4. `proceedToPayment(orderId)` resolves with the payment message `"Payment Successful"`.
5. The final `.then()` logs the payment message to the console.
6. If any step fails, the `.catch()` block logs the error.

---

### **Summary in Simple Terms**
1. **Promises** help handle asynchronous tasks (e.g., waiting for 5 seconds, processing payments) without nested callbacks.
2. **Promise chaining** allows you to process results step by step, passing data from one step to the next.
3. If anything goes wrong at any step, the `.catch()` block will handle the error, ensuring a clean flow.
