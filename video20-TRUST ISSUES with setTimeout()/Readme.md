```js
console.log("Start");
setTimeout(function cb() {
  console.log("Callback");
}, 5000);
console.log("End");

let startDate = new Date().getTime();
let endDate = startDate;
while (endDate < startDate + 10000) {
  endDate = new Date().getTime;
}
console.log("While expires");
```

let's break down the execution of this JavaScript code in terms of the JavaScript runtime environment:

1. **Call Stack**: The call stack is a data structure that keeps track of where we are in the program¹²³⁴. It runs in a last-in, first-out way¹²³⁴.

2. **Web APIs**: These are built-in libraries that can be accessed by your JavaScript code¹²³⁴. They provide various features that can be used in a web application¹²³⁴.

3. **Callback Queue**: This is a data structure that stores all the callback functions that are ready to be executed¹²³⁴.

4. **Event Loop**: The event loop takes functions from the callback queue and pushes them onto the call stack when the call stack is empty¹²³⁴.

Now, let's see how these components interact during the execution of your code:

1. When the JavaScript engine starts executing your code, it first encounters the `console.log("Start")` statement. This is pushed onto the call stack and executed immediately, logging "Start" to the console¹²³⁴.

2. Next, it encounters the `setTimeout` function. This function is part of the Web APIs provided by the browser¹²³⁴. The callback function `cb` and the delay of `5000` milliseconds are passed to the `setTimeout` function and it starts the timer¹²³⁴.

3. When the `setTimeout` function is called, it starts a timer in the Web APIs area, not the call stack. The callback function `cb` is also registered in the Web APIs area. When the timer expires (after 5000 milliseconds in your code), the callback function is moved to the Callback Queue.

4. The JavaScript engine then encounters the `console.log("End")` statement. This is pushed onto the call stack and executed immediately, logging "End" to the console¹²³⁴.

5. After `5000` milliseconds (or 5 seconds), the timer finishes. At this point, the callback function `cb` is placed in the Callback Queue¹²³⁴.

6. The JavaScript engine then encounters the while loop. This loop continues to run until `endDate` is not less than `startDate + 10000`. This loop blocks the call stack and prevents other JavaScript code from running¹²³⁴.

7. Once the while loop finishes, the `console.log("While expires")` statement is pushed onto the call stack and executed, logging "While expires" to the console¹²³⁴.

8. The Event Loop constantly checks if the call stack is empty¹²³⁴. Once it sees that the call stack is empty, it takes the callback function from the Callback Queue and pushes it onto the Call Stack for execution¹²³⁴.

9. Finally, the `console.log("Callback")` statement inside the callback function is executed, logging "Callback" to the console¹²³⁴.

So, the output of your code will be:

```
Start
End
While expires
Callback
```

This is a great example of how JavaScript handles asynchronous operations¹²³⁴. Even though the `setTimeout` function was encountered before `console.log("End")`, its callback wasn't executed until after because of the nature of the event loop¹²³⁴.

```js
console.log("Start");
setTimeout(function cb() {
  console.log("Callback");
}, 0);
console.log("End");
```

3. Meanwhile, the `setTimeout` function itself finishes executing and is removed from the call stack¹²³⁴.

4. The JavaScript engine then encounters the `console.log("End")` statement. This is pushed onto the call stack and executed immediately, logging "End" to the console¹²³⁴.

5. After `0` milliseconds (or immediately), the timer finishes. At this point, the callback function `cb` is placed in the Callback Queue¹²³⁴.
